# Hi, I'm James Hawkins 

I'm an independent researcher focused on theoretical physics â€” especially the optical and gravitational behavior of light near black holes. I created the **Photon Echo Model**, a novel theory proposing reflective quantum shells around black holes to explain brightness fluctuations observed by instruments like the EHT.

**Research Interests**
- General relativity and Kerr black holes
- Gravitational optics and photon paths
- Black hole imaging and photon echo simulations

**Latest Work**
- ðŸ“„ [Photon Echo Model â€“ arXiv Preprint (2025)] *coming soon*
- ðŸ’» [Photon Echo GitHub Repo] *coming soon*
- ðŸŽ“ [Slide Deck: Explaining the Photon Echo Model] *coming soon*

**Contact**
- Email: photon.echo.research@proton.me
- ORCID: *coming soon*
- Website: *Coming soon*

 *I'm always open to thoughtful questions, collaboration, or constructive critique.*
